## ðŸš€ About Me
Transitioning from a career in education, where I've served as a Licensed Professional Teacher specializing in Christian Living for two years, I am now pursuing a role as an analyst leveraging my background in Philosophy and minor in Psychology and Education. My experience in teaching has equipped me with strong analytical skills, effective communication, and the ability to interpret complex concepts. With a keen interest in data analysis, I am proficient in SQL programming and possess knowledge in POWERBI and similar reporting software. This career shift reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my desire to apply my skills in a dynamic and analytical role, contributing meaningfully to organizational success.
